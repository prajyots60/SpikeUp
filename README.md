🌟 SpikeUp — AI-Powered Webinar Sales Engine
Category: SaaS | Sales Automation | Marketing Tools
🚩 Problem — What’s Broken Today?

Most digital marketers, coaches, creators, and SaaS founders rely on webinars or VSLs (Video Sales Letters) to sell high-ticket products and services.
However, the current process is manual, expensive, and inefficient.

❌ The Real Problems

Manual Conversions

Human setters or sales agents are needed to message leads.

Costly, unscalable, and inconsistent in performance.

Poor Lead Engagement

Leads drop off after webinars with no follow-up or interaction.

Missed opportunities due to lack of engagement.

No Real-Time Personalization

Static “Buy Now” buttons and fixed offers.

No AI-driven conversations or dynamic offers.

Wasted Potential from High-Intent Leads

Only ~5% of attendees convert.

The rest are lost due to lack of timely follow-up.
