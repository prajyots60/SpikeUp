## 🚩 Problem — What’s Broken Today?

Most **digital marketers, coaches, creators,** and **SaaS founders** rely on **webinars or VSLs (Video Sales Letters)** to sell high-ticket products and services.  
However, the current process is **manual, expensive, and inefficient.**

### ❌ The Real Problems

#### 1. Manual Conversions
- Requires human setters or sales agents to message leads.
- Costly, unscalable, and inconsistent performance.

#### 2. Poor Lead Engagement
- Leads drop off after webinars with no follow-up or interaction.
- Missed opportunities due to lack of engagement and timely response.

#### 3. No Real-Time Personalization
- Static “Buy Now” buttons and fixed offers.
- No AI-driven dynamic conversations or personalized CTAs.

#### 4. Wasted Potential from High-Intent Leads
- Only ~5% of attendees convert.
- The rest are lost forever due to no real-time engagement or follow-up.
